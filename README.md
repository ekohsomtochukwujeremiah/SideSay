# Privalk

> **Your words belong to the moment, not the server.**

Privalk is a real-time messaging sanctuary built on the philosophy of ephemeral communication. In a world where everything is recorded, we offer the freedom of transience. Connect securely using unique keys or usernames, manage your private profile, and experience privacy by design.

## 🛡️ Core Philosophy

We believe that digital communication should mimic the natural, fleeting nature of face-to-face conversation. Privalk is designed to be a "Private Existence" platform where your digital footprint is minimized by default.

## ✨ Features

### ⏳ 3-Day Retention
**Ephemeral by default.** We save your chat for a maximum of 3 days. After that, conversations are automatically and permanently deleted from our servers. No history, no backups, no traces.

### 👻 Private Existence
**Hidden from the public eye.** Your username is the only way to connect. Your profile is not indexed, and your existence on the platform is private and hidden from public search or contact discovery algorithms.

### 🔒 Private & Secure
**Off-the-record.** End-to-end privacy designed for intimate conversations. We prioritize security architecture that ensures only the intended recipient can read your messages.

### 🤝 Connection Privacy
**Consent-based networking.** Your friends can only know of your existence on the platform after a successful connection is established. There are no "suggested friends" or public directories.
